# hubotAutoInvite
Auto invites Hubot to all the available slack channels. This can be run as a cron task where your hubot is deployed.

## Will not Work 
- Reason is because Slack does not allow bots to api join channels. It has to be done manually by typing: `/invite @hubot`

### TODO
- Enable this script when Slack actually decides to allow bots to auto join all channels.
